## üìñ PROJECT OVERVIEW 
This project analyzes trends in **Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (DR-TB)** cases in Nigeria from **2010 to 2022**, with a focus on diagnosis vs. treatment enrollment. A statistical forecasting model is also developed to predict DR-TB diagnoses from **2023 to 2032**.

## üîç DESCRIPTION
Despite efforts to control TB, **drug resistance** remains a serious public health issue. A substantial gap exists between diagnosed DR-TB cases and those enrolled in treatment. This project uses time series analysis to quantify this issue and project future burdens.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Over 13 years, the number of diagnosed DR-TB cases has increased drastically, but a treatment gap persists √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù meaning **many diagnosed patients are not receiving care**, which could fuel further spread and resistance.

## üéØ OBJECTIVE 

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Analyze DR-TB diagnosis and treatment trends** 

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Measure treatment coverage and gap** 

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Apply time series modeling (ARIMA) to forecast future diagnoses** 

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Recommend data-driven health interventions**

## üîç KEY AREAS ANALYZED
The analysis focused on the following critical areas:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **DR-TB diagnosis vs. treatment enrollment**  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Treatment coverage and yearly gaps**

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Trend decomposition**

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Forecasting using ARIMA**

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Visual analysis of patterns over time**

## üìä DATA SOURCE
The data was obtained from **NTBLCP** Data centre 

Here's the link to the dataset: https://ntblcp.org.ng/data-centre/

## üìä DATASET DESCRIPTION 
The dataset consist of:

‚úÖ **Year: Observation year (2010-2022)**

‚úÖ **Diagnosed: Number of DR-TB diagnosed cases**

‚úÖ **Enrolled: Number of DR-TB patients enrolled in treatment**

## ‚öíÔ∏è TOOLS USED:

Language: Python 

Libraries: (Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn,Statsmodels)

Jupyter Notebook 

## üìí METHODOLOGY 
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Load and clean dataset**

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Explore trends and relationships (EDA)**

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Calculate treatment gap and coverage**

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Conduct time series decomposition**

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Test stationarity (ADF Test)**

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Build ARIMA(1,1,1) model**

7Ô∏è‚É£ **Forecast future diagnoses (2023-2032)**


## üìå DATA CLEANING 
To ensure data quality the following preposition steps where performed 

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Check missing value 
Verified no missing values  

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Remove duplicate
To prevent data redundancy duplicate records were removed.

The results confirms no duplicate records exist in the dataset.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Formatting 
To ensure data consistency and accuracy:

‚úÖ Converted **Year** column to **datetime**

‚úÖ Set **Year** as index for **time series modeling**

‚úÖ Created additional metrics:

‚úÖ **Gap = Diagnosed - Enrolled** 

‚úÖ **Treatment Coverage (%) = (Enrolled / Diagnosed) * 100**

## üìà EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

**Descriptive statistics**

The dataset captures annual counts of drug-resistant TB diagnoses over a 13-year period, revealing clear trends and variability in case detection:

**Mean of diagnosed: 1580**

**Standard deviation: 1214**

**Minimum diagnosed case: 25**

**25%(Q1): 665**

**50%(Median): 1686**

**75%(Q3): 2286**

**Maximum diagnosed cases: 3932**



1Ô∏è‚É£ **Diagnosed cases** ranged from **25 (2010) to 3932 (2022)**, showing a **sharp and sustained increase** in detection over time likely due to improved surveillance, diagnostics, or rising incidence.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **The average number** of diagnosed cases was approximately **1,580 per year**, indicating a **moderate-to-high** burden of drug-resistant TB during the observed period.

3Ô∏è‚É£ The **minimum number** of diagnoses **(25 cases)** occurred in **2010**, possibly reflecting **early-stage** reporting infrastructure or under-detection.

4Ô∏è‚É£ The **median number** of diagnosed cases was **1686**, meaning that **half of the years** recorded fewer than **1686** cases, and the other half recorded more suggesting consistent upward growth in later years.

5Ô∏è‚É£ The **interquartile range (Q1‚ÄìQ3)** spans from **665 to 2286** cases, meaning that **50%** of the annual figures fell within this range  reflecting a **strong shift** in detection from **low to high** case counts across the decade.

## üîçüìùSTATISTICAL INSIGHTS AND DATA VISUALIZATION

‚úÖ **Diagnosed cases** rose from **25 (2010)** to **3932 (2022)**  

‚úÖ **Enrollment** improved but lagged: **23 to 3185**  

‚úÖ **Largest treatment gap: 778 cases (2021)**  

 ‚úÖ **Highest treatment coverage: 92% (2010)** 
 
 ‚úÖ **Lowest coverage: 51.88% (2013)**
 

 **Yearly trend of DR-TB diagnosed VS Enrolled cases** 
 
![Screenshot](Screenshot_20250613-201647.jpg)

The line chart shows a **strong upward trend** in the number of DR-TB cases diagnosed over time, rising from **25 cases in 2010 to 3,932 in 2022**. While treatment **enrollment** also **increased**, it consistently **lagged** behind diagnoses, creating a **persistent treatment gap**. 


**Treatment Gap by year**

The bar chart illustrates the number of diagnosed DR-TB patients not enrolled in treatment each year. The treatment gap remained small in the **early years (only 2 patients in 2010)** but began to **widen significantly from 2013 onward**. By **2021**, the gap reached a **peak of 778 untreated cases**. Despite increasing enrollment efforts, the gap indicates that treatment scale-up has not kept pace with rising diagnoses, **posing a major challenge for TB control efforts**.


## Time Series Decomposition

![Screenshot](Screenshot_20250613-201713.jpg)

We decomposed the diagnosis trend into:

‚úÖ **Trend:** Strong upward growth in cases  

‚úÖ **Seasonality:** Minimal due to yearly data granularity  

‚úÖ **Residual (Noise):** Unexplained random variations  

This helps visualize consistent trends and detect structural shifts or anomalies.
 
## Forecasting with ARIMA(1,1,1)

### Model Details:

‚úÖ **ARIMA(1,1,1)**  
 A time series model with one autoregressive term, one differencing step, and one moving average term.

‚úÖ **ADF Test (Original Series):**
**p-value = 0.9914** Indicates the series is **non-stationary** (i.e., has a trend or seasonality that needs to be removed).

‚úÖ **ADF Test (First Differenced Series):**
**p-value = 0.0000** After differencing, the series becomes **stationary**, which is a key requirement for **ARIMA modeling**.

‚úÖ **Model Fit (AIC = 185.07):**
A relatively low AIC value indicates a good fit for the data. Among similar models, lower AIC suggests a better trade-off between model accuracy and complexity.

‚úÖ **Residuals (Ljung-Box p = 0.79):**
Residuals appear to be white noise, they are random and show no remaining autocorrelation. This confirms that the model has successfully captured the structure in the data.

The **ARIMA(1,1,1)** model satisfies all key diagnostics **stationarity**, **low AIC**, and **random residuals** making it a **strong and reliable model** for **forecasting future DR-TB diagnosed cases**.

### Forecast Results

## ‚úÖ RECOMMENDATION 
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Extend Night-Time Operations:** Consider extending business hours, launching late-night combo deals, or offering exclusive night-time discounts.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Focus on Beverage Promotions:** Offer combo deals pairing beverages with fast foods. Create seasonal beverage bundles to boost average order value.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Promote Digital Payments**: Encourage UPI/QR code payments with small cashback, stamps, or discounts to reduce cash handling and boost efficiency.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Investigate Post-Peak Revenue Decline:** Conduct surveys, check competitor activity, and review marketing strategies to understand declining trends.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Implement Staff-Level Sales KPIs:** Track sales per employee per shift. Offer incentives like "Top Seller of the Month" or product upsell bonuses.

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Improve Data Collection Consistency:** Implement POS validation to require payment type input, ensuring more reliable analytics in the future.
