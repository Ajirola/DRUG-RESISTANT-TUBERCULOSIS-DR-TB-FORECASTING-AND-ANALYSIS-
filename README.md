## üìñ PROJECT OVERVIEW 
This project analyzes trends in **Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (DR-TB)** cases in Nigeria from **2010 to 2022**, with a focus on diagnosis vs. treatment enrollment. A statistical forecasting model is also developed to predict DR-TB diagnoses from **2023 to 2032**.

## üîç DESCRIPTION
Despite efforts to control TB, **drug resistance** remains a serious public health issue. A substantial gap exists between diagnosed DR-TB cases and those enrolled in treatment. This project uses time series analysis to quantify this issue and project future burdens.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Over 13 years, the number of diagnosed DR-TB cases has increased drastically, but a treatment gap persists √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù meaning **many diagnosed patients are not receiving care**, which could fuel further spread and resistance.

## üéØ OBJECTIVE 

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Analyze DR-TB diagnosis and treatment trends** 

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Measure treatment coverage and gap** 

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Apply time series modeling (ARIMA) to forecast future diagnoses** 

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Recommend data-driven health interventions**

## üîç KEY AREAS ANALYZED
The analysis focused on the following critical areas:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **DR-TB diagnosis vs. treatment enrollment**  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Treatment coverage and yearly gaps**

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Trend decomposition**

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Forecasting using ARIMA**

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Visual analysis of patterns over time**

## üìä DATA SOURCE
The data was obtained from **NTBLCP** Data centre 

Here's the link to the dataset: https://ntblcp.org.ng/data-centre/

## üìä DATASET DESCRIPTION 
The dataset consist of:

‚úÖ **Year: Observation year (2010-2022)**

‚úÖ **Diagnosed: Number of DR-TB diagnosed cases**

‚úÖ **Enrolled: Number of DR-TB patients enrolled in treatment**

## ‚öíÔ∏è TOOLS USED:

Language: Python 

Libraries: (Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn,Statsmodels)

Jupyter Notebook 

## üìí METHODOLOGY 
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Load and clean dataset**

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Explore trends and relationships (EDA)**

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Calculate treatment gap and coverage**

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Conduct time series decomposition**

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Test stationarity (ADF Test)**

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Build ARIMA(1,1,1) model**

7Ô∏è‚É£ **Forecast future diagnoses (2023-2032)**


## üìå DATA CLEANING 
To ensure data quality the following preposition steps where performed 

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Check missing value 
Verified no missing values  

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Remove duplicate
To prevent data redundancy duplicate records were removed.
The results confirms no duplicate records exist in the dataset.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Formatting 
To ensure data consistency and accuracy:

‚úÖ Converted **Year** column to **datetime**

‚úÖ Set **Year** as index for **time series modeling**

‚úÖ Created additional metrics:

‚úÖ **Gap = Diagnosed - Enrolled** 

‚úÖ **Treatment Coverage (%) = (Enrolled / Diagnosed) * 100**

## üìà EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

**Descriptive statistics**

The sales data consists of 1000 records, exhibiting the following character:

**Mean Sales**: **275.23**

**Standard deviation**: **204.40**

**Minimum sales**: **20.00**

**25%(Q1)**: **120.00**

**50%(Median)**: **240.00**

**75%(Q3)**: **360.00**

**Maximum Sales**: **900.00**

1Ô∏è‚É£ Sales ranged from **20.00** to **900.00**, indicating a **wide variation** in customer spending habits.

2Ô∏è‚É£ The average sales value is **275.23**, suggesting that most customers make **moderately** priced purchases.

3Ô∏è‚É£ The smallest recorded transaction was **20.00**, likely reflecting a **single low-cost** item purchase.

4Ô∏è‚É£ 50% of the sales are **240.00**, indicating a **midpoint** sales distribution.

## ‚úÖ RECOMMENDATION 
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Extend Night-Time Operations:** Consider extending business hours, launching late-night combo deals, or offering exclusive night-time discounts.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Focus on Beverage Promotions:** Offer combo deals pairing beverages with fast foods. Create seasonal beverage bundles to boost average order value.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Promote Digital Payments**: Encourage UPI/QR code payments with small cashback, stamps, or discounts to reduce cash handling and boost efficiency.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Investigate Post-Peak Revenue Decline:** Conduct surveys, check competitor activity, and review marketing strategies to understand declining trends.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Implement Staff-Level Sales KPIs:** Track sales per employee per shift. Offer incentives like "Top Seller of the Month" or product upsell bonuses.

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Improve Data Collection Consistency:** Implement POS validation to require payment type input, ensuring more reliable analytics in the future.
