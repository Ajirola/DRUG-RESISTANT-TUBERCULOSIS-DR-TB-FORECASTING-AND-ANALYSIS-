## üìñ PROJECT OVERVIEW 
This project analyzes trends in **Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (DR-TB)** cases in Nigeria from **2010 to 2022**, with a focus on diagnosis vs. treatment enrollment. A statistical forecasting model is also developed to predict DR-TB diagnoses from **2023 to 2032**.

## üîç DESCRIPTION
Despite efforts to control TB, **drug resistance** remains a serious public health issue. A substantial gap exists between diagnosed DR-TB cases and those enrolled in treatment. This project uses time series analysis to quantify this issue and project future burdens.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Over 13 years, the number of diagnosed DR-TB cases has increased drastically, but a treatment gap persists √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù meaning **many diagnosed patients are not receiving care**, which could fuel further spread and resistance.

## üéØ OBJECTIVE 

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Analyze DR-TB diagnosis and treatment trends** 

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Measure treatment coverage and gap** 

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Apply time series modeling (ARIMA) to forecast future diagnoses** 

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Recommend data-driven health interventions**
- 

## üîç KEY AREAS ANALYZED
The analysis focused on the following critical areas:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **DR-TB diagnosis vs. treatment enrollment**  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Treatment coverage and yearly gaps**

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Trend decomposition**

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Forecasting using ARIMA**

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Visual analysis of patterns over time**

## üìä DATA SOURCE
The data was obtained from kaggle website

Here's the link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajatsurana979/fast-food-sales-report

## ‚öíÔ∏è TOOLS USED:

Python (Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn,Plotly)

Jupyter Notebook 

## üìí METHODOLOGY 
1Ô∏è‚É£ Data cleaning and preprocessing 

2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Statistical Insights and Data Visualization 

4Ô∏è‚É£ Business Recommendation for balaji fast food

## üìå DATA CLEANING 
To ensure data quality the following preposition steps where performed 

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Handle missing value 
After examining the dataset which consist of 1000rows and 10 colums, analysis revealed that 107 records of 1000 records in transaction type contain missing value.
To maintain data integrity missing value were identified and replaced with 'Unknown'.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Remove duplicate
To prevent data redundancy duplicate records were removed.
The results confirms no duplicate records exist in the dataset.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Formatting 
To ensure data consistency and accuracy, the date column was converted from object to date format and extracted month from date for monthly analysis.


## üìà EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

**Descriptive statistics**

The sales data consists of 1000 records, exhibiting the following character:

**Mean Sales**: **275.23**
