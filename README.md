## üìñ PROJECT OVERVIEW 
This project analyzes trends in **Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (DR-TB)** cases in Nigeria from **2010 to 2022**, with a focus on diagnosis vs. treatment enrollment. A statistical forecasting model is also developed to predict DR-TB diagnoses from **2023 to 2032**.

## üîç DESCRIPTION
Despite efforts to control TB, **drug resistance** remains a serious public health issue. A substantial gap exists between diagnosed DR-TB cases and those enrolled in treatment. This project uses time series analysis to quantify this issue and project future burdens.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT 
Over 13 years, the number of diagnosed DR-TB cases has increased drastically, but a treatment gap persists √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù meaning **many diagnosed patients are not receiving care**, which could fuel further spread and resistance.

## üéØ OBJECTIVE 

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Analyze DR-TB diagnosis and treatment trends** 

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Measure treatment coverage and gap** 

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Apply time series modeling (ARIMA) to forecast future diagnoses** 

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Recommend data-driven health interventions**

## üîç KEY AREAS ANALYZED
The analysis focused on the following critical areas:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **DR-TB diagnosis vs. treatment enrollment**  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Treatment coverage and yearly gaps**

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Trend decomposition**

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Forecasting using ARIMA**

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Visual analysis of patterns over time**

## üìä DATA SOURCE
The data was obtained from **NTBLCP** Data centre 

Here's the link to the dataset: https://ntblcp.org.ng/data-centre/

## üìä DATASET DESCRIPTION 
The dataset consist of:

‚úÖ **Year: Observation year (2010-2022)**

‚úÖ **Diagnosed: Number of DR-TB diagnosed cases**

‚úÖ **Enrolled: Number of DR-TB patients enrolled in treatment**

## ‚öíÔ∏è TOOLS USED:

Language: Python 

Libraries: (Pandas,Matplotlib,Seaborn,Statsmodels)

Jupyter Notebook 

## üìí METHODOLOGY 
1Ô∏è‚É£ **Load and clean dataset**

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Explore trends and relationships (EDA)**

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Calculate treatment gap and coverage**

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Conduct time series decomposition**

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Test stationarity (ADF Test)**

6Ô∏è‚É£ **Build ARIMA(1,1,1) model**

7Ô∏è‚É£ **Forecast future diagnoses (2023-2032)**


## üìå DATA CLEANING 
To ensure data quality the following preposition steps where performed 

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Check missing value 
Verified no missing values  

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Remove duplicate
To prevent data redundancy duplicate records were removed.

The results confirms no duplicate records exist in the dataset.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Formatting 
To ensure data consistency and accuracy:

‚úÖ Converted **Year** column to **datetime**

‚úÖ Set **Year** as index for **time series modeling**

‚úÖ Created additional metrics:

‚úÖ **Gap = Diagnosed - Enrolled** 

‚úÖ **Treatment Coverage (%) = (Enrolled / Diagnosed) * 100**

## üìà EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

**Descriptive statistics**

The dataset captures annual counts of drug-resistant TB diagnoses over a 13-year period, revealing clear trends and variability in case detection:

**Mean of diagnosed: 1580**

**Standard deviation: 1214**

**Minimum diagnosed case: 25**

**25%(Q1): 665**

**50%(Median): 1686**

**75%(Q3): 2286**

**Maximum diagnosed cases: 3932**



1Ô∏è‚É£ **Diagnosed cases** ranged from **25 (2010) to 3932 (2022)**, showing a **sharp and sustained increase** in detection over time likely due to improved surveillance, diagnostics, or rising incidence.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **The average number** of diagnosed cases was approximately **1,580 per year**, indicating a **moderate-to-high** burden of drug-resistant TB during the observed period.

3Ô∏è‚É£ The **minimum number** of diagnoses **(25 cases)** occurred in **2010**, possibly reflecting **early-stage** reporting infrastructure or under-detection.

4Ô∏è‚É£ The **median number** of diagnosed cases was **1686**, meaning that **half of the years** recorded fewer than **1686** cases, and the other half recorded more suggesting consistent upward growth in later years.

5Ô∏è‚É£ The **interquartile range (Q1‚ÄìQ3)** spans from **665 to 2286** cases, meaning that **50%** of the annual figures fell within this range  reflecting a **strong shift** in detection from **low to high** case counts across the decade.

## üîçüìùSTATISTICAL INSIGHTS AND DATA VISUALIZATION

‚úÖ **Diagnosed cases** rose from **25 (2010)** to **3932 (2022)**  

‚úÖ **Enrollment** improved but lagged: **23 to 3185**  

‚úÖ **Largest treatment gap: 778 cases (2021)**  

 ‚úÖ **Highest treatment coverage: 92% (2010)** 
 
 ‚úÖ **Lowest coverage: 51.88% (2013)**
 

 **Yearly trend of DR-TB diagnosed VS Enrolled cases** 

![Screenshot](Screenshot_20250613-201647.jpg)

The line chart shows a **strong upward trend** in the number of DR-TB cases diagnosed over time, rising from **25 cases in 2010 to 3,932 in 2022**. While treatment **enrollment** also **increased**, it consistently **lagged** behind diagnoses, creating a **persistent treatment gap**. 


**Treatment Gap by year**

The bar chart illustrates the number of diagnosed DR-TB patients not enrolled in treatment each year. The treatment gap remained small in the **early years (only 2 patients in 2010)** but began to **widen significantly from 2013 onward**. By **2021**, the gap reached a **peak of 778 untreated cases**. Despite increasing enrollment efforts, the gap indicates that treatment scale-up has not kept pace with rising diagnoses, **posing a major challenge for TB control efforts**.


## Time Series Decomposition

![Screenshot](Screenshot_20250613-201713.jpg)

We decomposed the diagnosis trend into:

‚úÖ **Trend:** Strong upward growth in cases  

‚úÖ **Seasonality:** Minimal due to yearly data granularity  

‚úÖ **Residual (Noise):** Unexplained random variations  

This helps visualize consistent trends and detect structural shifts or anomalies.
 
## Forecasting with ARIMA(1,1,1)

### Model Details:

‚úÖ **ARIMA(1,1,1)**  
 A time series model with one autoregressive term, one differencing step, and one moving average term.

‚úÖ **ADF Test (Original Series):**
**p-value = 0.9914** Indicates the series is **non-stationary** (i.e., has a trend or seasonality that needs to be removed).

‚úÖ **ADF Test (First Differenced Series):**
**p-value = 0.0000** After differencing, the series becomes **stationary**, which is a key requirement for **ARIMA modeling**.

‚úÖ **Model Fit (AIC = 185.07):**
A relatively low AIC value indicates a good fit for the data. Among similar models, lower AIC suggests a better trade-off between model accuracy and complexity.

‚úÖ **Residuals (Ljung-Box p = 0.79):**
Residuals appear to be white noise, they are random and show no remaining autocorrelation. This confirms that the model has successfully captured the structure in the data.

The **ARIMA(1,1,1)** model satisfies all key diagnostics **stationarity**, **low AIC**, and **random residuals** making it a **strong and reliable model** for **forecasting future DR-TB diagnosed cases**.

### Forecast Results 

| Year | Forecasted Diagnosed Cases |
|------|-----------------------------|
| 2023 | 4,219                       |
| 2024 | 4,508                       |
| 2025 | 4,796                       |
| 2026 | 5,084                       |
| 2027 | 5,371                       |
| 2028 | 5,659                       |
| 2029 | 5,947                       |
| 2030 | 6,235                       |
| 2031 | 6,523                       |
| 2032 | 6,811                       |

Without intervention, diagnosed DR-TB cases may rise to **7,000/year by 2032**.

## RECOMMENDATION 

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Strengthen Treatment Enrollment Systems**
The persistent gap between diagnosed and enrolled cases  peaking at 778 untreated patients in 2021 ‚Äî indicates the need to scale up treatment infrastructure, improve linkage to care, and reduce delays after diagnosis.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Implement Forecast-Driven Resource Planning**
With forecasted DR-TB diagnoses expected to rise to nearly 6,800 by 2032, healthcare programs must use predictive insights to guide decisions around budgeting, medication procurement, staffing, and facility capacity.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Expand Community-Based Case Management**
To reduce the enrollment gap, introduce or strengthen community follow-up systems and patient navigation programs that ensure diagnosed individuals are tracked and supported through treatment initiation.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Enhance Data Systems for Real-Time Monitoring**
Incorporate more frequent data collection (e.g., monthly or quarterly) and build interactive dashboards to allow early detection of enrollment gaps or service delivery issues enabling faster policy response.


5Ô∏è‚É£ **Invest in Preventive and Early Detection Programs**
With the trend showing a steady increase in diagnoses, upstream interventions such as public awareness, screening programs, and contact tracing are essential to slow transmission and reduce long-term disease burden.
